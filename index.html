                    <h2>Why I Run</h2>
                    <p>
                        I never ran competitively in school, but when the stress of law school set in, I discovered running was the perfect way for me to find balance in my life. By graduation I'd run two half marathons and was totally hooked. I knew at some point I might want to run a full marathon, and when a friend offered me a spot to run in the 2017 London Marathon, I had to take the leap.

                    <h2>Training for London</h2>
                    <p>
                        Following an 18-week training program from December 2016 up to race day, April 20, 2017, I ran nearly 460 miles. Working my way from three, four, and five miles, I trained at distances all the way to 18, 19, and 20 miles. Kansas City is a wonderful city for running. All the rolling hills, from the River Market to the southern reaches of the Trolley Trail, served as great training grounds. It's also a great way to see the city's neighborhoods. All I could think about on those last miles were all the pizza and beer I'd have after.

                    <p>
                        I decided to spend the last week of training, at that point tapering to a few more short runs, exploring as much of Iceland as I could fit into five days and four nights. On my own, I figured what better way to do it than with the freedom of a camper-van? I saw glaciers, waterfalls, geysers, volcanoes, and some extremely photogenic horses. I had some amazing views as I fit in the last few training runs.

                            The weather changes by the hour, creating highly contrasting colors and lighting. Icelandic horses are also extremely photogenic.

                    <h2>Going the Distance</h2>
                    <p>
                        After all the physical and mental preparation, I was ready to go. Starting in Greenwich Park south of the Thames River, the marathon course winds through streets jam packed with spectators cheering from beginning to end. With around 40,000 runners, you had to be careful in weaving through the traffic of the pack. When you reach the tower bridge, you know you're halfway done. I did a pretty good job of pacing myself early on, and I even picked up some steam on the back half... well, until maybe the last three miles. Those were tough, but with the roar of London carrying me forward, I passed the Houses of Parliament and raced toward Buckingham Palace. The rush of emotions, from pure joy to the pain of having completely emptied the tank, was overwhelming.

                    <p>I'd do it again in a heartbeat. If you're going to do a marathon, you might as well make it a big race if you can. Stick to your training plan, stretch twice a day, eat lots of healthy calories, and drink lots of water. No magic tricks, and anyone can do it!</p>
